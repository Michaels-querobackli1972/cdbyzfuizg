Okay, just saw Plankton: The Movie and I’m like a shaken soda can trying to make sense of it all. The theater is still ringing in my ears, and I’m tasting those stale popcorn kernels that somehow always sneak into the bottom of the box. My back hurts from leaning forward too much because I think I was subconsciously trying to dive into the screen with them.

The plot – or what can be considered the plot – is this wild rollercoaster of microscopic adventures. Imagine a bunch of plankton with hints of Attenborough’s voice leading an epic journey of survival with existential undertones, like if my biology textbook had a midlife crisis and started ranting about its place in the universe. It's like Finding Nemo but on a pollen grain or something, with layers as unpredictable as Jenga played during an earthquake.

> There was this scene where the plankton or whatever was surfing on waves of krill, right? And I swear it felt a bit like one of those dreams where you're late for school, riding a skateboard made of spaghetti. I laughed so loud that the person next to me gave me the slurred side-eye like dude we get it, they’re just planktons. 

Sometimes the colors were so vivid – like splashes of cobalt and emerald fighting a glorious battle under the sunbeam spotlight – that I felt like I was wearing Technicolor goggles from another dimension. Then there was that odd subplot with the seagull philosopher, dropping truth bombs like some feathery guru. Kept wondering if I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 that part and get all wise.

Oh, and don't even get me started on the music. Sea shanties meet orchestral drama; it was like listening to a whale with a P𝘏𝘋 in music theory argue with a haunted accordion. I think I've still got fragments of those tunes stuck somewhere between my cochlea and the lyrics to a jingle I forgot years ago.

Dammit, remember when Mark asked if we should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   together next week? It's going to induce the most vivid plankton-inspired dreams. Floating in the stars of the sea, the credits rolled like ripples in time, urging you to reconsider life choices and your lack of aquarium visits.
